Hello Customer,


I'd first like to thank you for using our product! After doing some review, there seems to be an issue
with the current exported data. On line 7 there is an error where the "Note" is causing some confusion.
Additionally the system requires data imports to be pipe delimited instead of comma delimited 
in order for your systems to import the data properly.
